I'm participating in this year's cohort of the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2023.](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) This is a community-led, free data engineering course of about 8 weeks. In this blog, I'll summarise the steps to configure a Google Virtual Machine to make it ready for the rest of the course.

## Configure SSH Keys

Generate a new SSH key with the following commands:

```bash
cd ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f <key-file-name> -C <username> -b 2048
```

It'll raise a prompt to enter a passphrase. You can leave it and press `enter`. If it asks for confirmation, press `enter` again. Here's an example:

This generates 2 files in the .ssh folder, one for the public (`gcp-blog.pub`) and one for the private key (`gcp-blog`).

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676808454293/65b3151b-8e81-44d4-bad4-d773350341f5.png align="center")

Next, upload the public key to GCP with the following steps:

* Open the `gcp-blog.pub` file and copy its contents. Or you can use the `cat` command to display the contents in the terminal.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676959147606/be6e4c24-d37d-4648-8db1-25e3a5af226d.png align="center")

* Go to the Google Cloud console &gt; Compute Engine &gt; Settings &gt; Metadata.

* Click on SSH Keys &gt; Add SSH Keys
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676958954494/e1839785-46aa-47d7-9521-c53beafff57a.png align="center")

* Paste the contents of the public key that you copied previously on the text box and click Save.

Now, you can connect to your Google VMs using the following command:

```bash
ssh -i <PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY> <USERNAME>@<EXTERNAL_IP>
```

## Create a Virtual Machine

To set up a Virtual Machine:

* Go to Compute Engine &gt; VM Instances
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676960349912/be0d9107-6b5c-4cb1-b42c-267f86b23ac2.png align="center")

* Click on Create Instance.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676960443427/43d7004b-5764-4695-b70d-e5b8aa2b85cd.png align="center")

* Populate the configurations for the VM with the following details (*Name and Region can be as per your preference*):
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676960829175/4d599ca8-df67-4c2b-b8eb-09c9a1c393bc.png align="center")

* Next, change the boot disk with the following configurations:
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676964375425/41f1d4b8-dbc0-4151-ae37-5dff3699d368.png align="center")

* Leave the rest of the configurations to default values and click Create.
    

This will spin up a virtual machine instance for you. In order to ssh into this instance, run the following command:

```bash
ssh -i <PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY> <USERNAME>@<EXTERNAL_IP>
```

Here's an example on my system:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676964776339/6ae41758-2a8b-41b4-bbc0-a1341b49718c.png align="center")

You can also configure an ssh alias, which is a convenient way to store the ssh details in a config file. You can follow my blog on this and set up your alias to easily connect with a VM.

%[https://itsadityagupta.hashnode.dev/ssh-simplified-aliasing-credentials-with-config-files] 

I have created an alias for the VM by the name `dezoomcamp`. Here's the new command to ssh:

```bash
ssh dezoomcamp
```

> If you want to connect to a VM using any other options, please go through the official documentation on [**Connecting to VMs**](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/connect/standard-ssh#connect_to_vms)**.**

## Configure the Virtual Machine

Now that you have a Virtual Machine running and a way to ssh into it and run Linux commands, let's start with installing the requirements of the course to make it ready for development.

#### Installing Anaconda

* Visit [Anaconda's website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and copy the link to Linux 64-Bit Installer.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676965555810/fde6028a-9b3f-49c1-a9a2-6bba3b37fd21.png align="center")

* Download the file in the VM:
    
* ```bash
        wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2022.10-Linux-x86_64.sh
    ```
    
* Run the downloaded file:
    
* ```bash
        bash Anaconda3-2022.10-Linux-x86_64.sh
    ```
    
* Keep pressing Enter to scroll down and enter `yes` to accept the license terms.
    
* Press Enter to confirm the default location.
    
* Enter `yes` to run the `conda init` when asked.
    
* After the installation is complete, run the command `source .bashrc` to apply the changes to the `.bashrc` file. Alternatively, you can log out of the session using the `logout` command and then ssh back in for the changes to take effect.
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676966299230/ef36655c-fcfe-4096-bee4-acb02e48a2f2.png align="center")

You'll notice the anaconda environment name in the shell prompt once the changes are applied. Also, from the above image it is confirmed that python is also installed.

#### Installing Docker

Run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install docker.io
```

This will install docker but you'll not be able to run it without `sudo`. It'll throw a permission denied error:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676966712431/e49b7047-f3e2-4a51-9b95-25a9b2cb099b.png align="center")

To run docker without `sudo`, run the following commands:

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker
sudo service docker restart
```

(Refer to [this link](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/main/docker-without-sudo.md) for an explanation of the above commands.)

Log out of the ssh session and log back in to re-evaluate the group memberships and try running the `docker run hello-world` command.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1676967224382/7bd906e1-1790-47b1-bda1-8558bc33c11e.png align="center")

This time it works!

#### Installing docker-compose

* Go to the docker-compose [GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker/compose) and under the latest release, find the "`docker-compose-linux-x86_64`" asset and copy its link.
    
* Create a new `bin` folder in VM and download the asset into it:
    
* ```bash
        mkdir bin
        cd bin
        wget https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.16.0/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -O docker-compose
    ```
    
* This will create a new file `docker-compose` in the `bin` folder.
    
* Make this file executable:
    
* ```bash
        chmod +x docker-compose
    ```
    
* Now, add the bin folder to the path:
    
    * Go to the home directory: `cd`
        
    * Open the .bashrc file: `nano .bashrc`
        
    * Paste the following to the end of the `.bashrc` file:
        
    * ```bash
            export PATH="${HOME}/bin:${PATH}"
        ```
        
    * Press `Ctrl+O` &gt; `enter` &gt; `Ctrl+X`
        
    * Run `source .bashrc` for the changes to take effect.
        

Now, you have docker-compose installed as well.

#### Installing Pgcli

Pgcli is used to connect to the Postgres database and execute queries. It can be installed using the following command:

```bash
pip install pgcli
```

Once the installation is complete, you can connect to a Postgres database using the command:

```bash
pgcli -h <hostname> -u <username> -d <database-name>
```

It will prompt for the password afterwards.

#### Installing Terraform

* Go to terraform's [installation website](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads).
    
* Copy the link for Linux's AMD64 file.
    
* ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677043960701/f9352f96-1ed2-4385-a370-d5dac99c9955.png align="center")
    
    Go to the bin folder created previously and download the file using `wget`:
    
* ```bash
      cd ~/bin
      wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.3.9/terraform_1.3.9_linux_amd64.zip
    ```
    
* To unzip this file, install the unzip package:
    
* ```bash
      sudo apt-get install unzip
    ```
    
* Now, unzip the file:
    
* ```bash
      unzip terraform_1.3.9_linux_amd64.zip
    ```
    
* There will be a `terraform` executable file extracted. You can delete the zip file.
    
* Since this file is in the bin folder and the bin folder is in the path, everything is set up.
    
* Try running the following command to verify terraform's installation:
    
* ```bash
      terraform --version
    ```

#### Creating a service account

* Go to IAM and Admin &gt; Service Accounts
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677046425534/dca26177-3aaf-4423-bb7f-3c4c6a91caba.png align="center")

* Click on the "Create Service Account" button at the top and provide the service account name.
    
* Assign the following roles to this service account:
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677047523030/7c8ce8d5-be46-4c1d-83de-e77dea1789fe.png align="center")

* Click Done. The service account is now created.
    
* To generate keys for this service account, click on the 3-dot menu and then on "manage keys"
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677047814762/1d1e9382-ac2c-4f7e-acd0-8a8a2a2a1553.png align="center")

* On the following page, click on Add Key &gt; Create new key&gt; JSON format. Click Create.
    
* This will download a JSON file. This is to be uploaded to the VM using SFTP.
    
* Navigate to the path of the downloaded file on the terminal and open an SFTP connection by running the command: `sftp <ssh-alias-name>.`
    
* Next, create a folder `.gcp` and upload the credentials file into it by running the following commands:
    
* ```bash
      mkdir .gcp
      put <credentials-file-name> .gcp/
    ```
    
* This will upload the file to VM. Here's a screenshot from my system:
    
* ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677048420681/6ed1273b-17fd-4fa4-b108-8fb4825e46cc.png align="center")
    

#### Authenticate GCP using the service account credentials

To authenticate GCP, we need to set an environment variable `$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to point to the service account JSON file.

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/home/aditya/.gcp/<credentials-filename>.json
```

Next, authenticate GCP using the following command:

```bash
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file $GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
```

Here's my example:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677048891324/d452eb5c-ba02-4da8-b3e1-fc8f220706b7.png align="center")

#### Installing Pyspark

Instructions to install spark on Linux are well documented on the course's GitHub repository.

You can follow the below 2 files in the mentioned order, to install Pyspark:

1. [`linux.md`](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/week_5_batch_processing/setup/linux.md)
    
2. [`pyspark.md`](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/week_5_batch_processing/setup/pyspark.md)
    

> Tip: You can write all the environment variables mentioned in the above 2 files to `.bashrc` followed by the `source .bashrc` command to make the variables permanent. Otherwise they'll need to be setup everytime you restart your VM.

#### Cloning the course repo

Clone the [course repo](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) into the home directory. Your final folder structure should look something like this:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677050146025/d9ddf857-5671-4c69-9bad-d9e4c1621149.png align="center")

#### Open a Remote Connection from Visual Studio Code

Install the "Remote-SSH" extension.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1677049700312/6b32e4ce-5380-4787-bb12-23d1ed8fef67.png align="center")

Press `F1` and select "`Remote SSH: Connect to Host`". It will show you the hosts configured on your system.

Select the one associated with your Virtual Machine.

Open the course repo folder and you're all set to start your development!
