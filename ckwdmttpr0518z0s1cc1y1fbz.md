Hi Friends,

From the past few days, I'm coming across a lot of tweets from people stating that they're suffering from burnout after an extensive week, and asking for advice on the same. Though I'm not a mental expert, I've been through this state and I can say that I have come out of this just by reading a book.

But first, *why do we feel burnout? Are you doing something wrong?* I bet no.

You must be doing everything right and still feel this burnout because the problem is that you're pushing your limits to extremes when doing a task at hand. 

At times, we get involved in so many things,  or if not in many things, then in one thing itself that we have no idea about how extremely we're using our body's resources. We'll work on that thing the day after another thinking that we're enjoying it and then there comes a day when that same thing starts tiring us.

> Remember: **Our concentration, as well as our willpower, is limited.**

And if you're pushing yourself to an extreme for a long period of time, you're using these resources to completion without giving them the time to recharge. That's leading to your burnout.

From what I've experienced, you can prevent it using a simple trick!


### **STOP when you're doing GOOD.**

Yes! It's that simple. You don't have to stretch yourself unless your willpower to do that thing depletes or you start getting bored (or "use-to") of that thing you're doing.

All it will take is to realize that you've now reached a certain threshold of your capacity and stop doing that thing. **Even if you were enjoying that!**

Though simple, there can be instances when you may have an extreme urge to not stop. 
> But remember: **To go far, you have to go slow.**

And one more thing, I got this advice from a book: Atomic Habits!

This is all that I've to say today. Thanks for reading this.

If you're someone who has been on this path and got your way out, do share your experience.
