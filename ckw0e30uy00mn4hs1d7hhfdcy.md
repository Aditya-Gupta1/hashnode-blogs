Hi friends, I'm a computer science graduate, and a few months back got placed in a good company. It took me more than eight months to get this opportunity. The job searching period was long and it was definitely not easy.

Today, I'll reflect upon that time and share with you what I think worked and helped me in the process.


#### 1. Your online presence matters.

The more you and your work are visible to others, the more people will want to help you. It can be with referrals or guidance.

#### 2. You'll never be prepared.

Remember, you'll never be prepared. So never reject any opportunity that comes your way, "feeling" you can't do it.

#### 3. You need one yes.

You just need one offer. All the rejections that you're facing are meant to make you better. Treat them as redirection and learn from them.

#### 4. Your work is much more important than your compensation.

You'll not understand it until you get to work. But it is true. A high paying job in which you have no interest won't satisfy you.

#### 5. Ask for help.

Whenever you feel stuck, ask for help. To seniors, to professionals on LinkedIn or anyone capable enough. You can't decide everything yourself. At least for the first time.
> If you don't ask, the answer is always no.

#### 6. Respect other's time

When asking for help, remember that the other person is also busy. So, be very clear and concise in what you want help with. And be polite.

#### 7. Don't associate your dream with a job.

If you can dream, dream something bigger. There's no point associating yourself with a "brand" when you're not satisfied with the work that you would do.

Associate yourself with a purpose and find a place where you can work towards it.

#### 8. Stop Preparing. Start Doing
Reading tips for a good resume is preparation. Tailoring your resume is an action.
Finding websites for the job hunt is preparation. Actually applying to jobs is an action.

Identify the difference in activities, whether it has a valuable outcome or not.
